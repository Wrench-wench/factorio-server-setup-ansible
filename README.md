# Headless Factorio setup on CentOS or Ubuntu

A quick guide for how to setup and configure a Factorio headless server on a Linux server or container.
I've also included a script file I wrote that was the original template of this project.

In essence, this guide aims to download the server files and install them. This might also cover some networking elements if I feel like it later on.

Written for CentOS 7, CentOS 8 Stream, and Ubuntu server 22.04/20.04 LTS.
Milage may vary depending your platform.

## Prerequites

An installed CentOS or Ubuntu server with SSH access setup, and sudo access for the ansible user.
